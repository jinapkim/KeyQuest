Anna Sorokin (born January 23, 1991) is a Russian-born German convicted fraudster. Between 2013 and 2017, while living in the United States, she pretended to be a wealthy German heiress under the name Anna Delvey, and in 2017, she was arrested after allegedly defrauding banks, hotels, and acquaintances of a total of $275,000. She was convicted of multiple counts of attempted grand larceny, larceny in the second degree, and theft of services in relation to these offenses in 2019 and she served 4 years of jail time, including time at Rikers Island. A 9-episode television adaptation of her story titled Inventing Anna was developed by Netflix; it was the most watched show on Netflix during the week of its release in February 2022. Sorokin's compensation for her life story went to pay her victims and her legal fees. She is currently held in custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, pending deportation, which she is legally contesting.
Sorokin was born on January 23, 1991[2] in Domodedovo, a working-class satellite town south of Moscow. She was one of two children of the family. Her father was a truck driver, while her mother owned a small convenience store before becoming a housewife.[3] The family moved to Germany in 2007, when Anna was 16.[4] She attended the girls' gymnasium in Eschweiler and was described by peers there as a quiet girl who had a difficult time with the German language.[5]
Sorokin graduated from gymnasium (secondary school) in 2011 and moved to London to attend Central Saint Martins, but quit and returned to Germany. She was an intern at a public relations company before relocating to Paris to begin an internship for the French fashion magazine Purple, where she earned â‚¬400/month and her parents subsidized her rent.[5] At that time, she started calling herself Anna Delvey supposedly after her mother's maiden name; however, her parents have said that they "do not recognize the surname".[6]
