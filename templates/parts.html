                The case is what hold everything together and protects it from the elements. 
                You can choose different case materials depending on how durable, aesthetic, or see-through you want your keyboard to be.
                Common case materials are aluminum or plastic. 
            </p>
            <img class="guideImg2" src="\static\photos\pcb.jpg">
            <p>
                Keyboard PCB, the heart of the keyboard, is a printed circuit board where switches and everything else fits. The PCB you choose needs to be 
                compatible with the case you chose. Common things to think about when selecting a PCB are compatibility with mechanical switches and software. 
                Mechanical switches either have three or five pins, which help the switches sit on top of the PCB. Keep in mind that a PCB that supports 5-pin
                switches will be compatible with more switches. PCBs can also be compatible with software like QMK or VIA, which allow users to program their keys 
                and customize their keyboard based on their needs. Software can also be used to control things like RGB lighting.
            </p>
            <img class="guideImg2" src="\static\photos\plate.jpg">
            <p>
                In some keyboards, a plate is an optional component. It goes on top of the PCB and holds switches in place and adds overall rigidity to the build. 
                There are many different materials that a plate can be made of- aluminum, brass, polycarbonate, POM plastic, etc. Different materials have
                different stiffness, so depending on your plate choice you can select how soft or firm your typing experience is.

            <p>
                Stabilizers are used for larger keys like the spacebar, enter, and shift keys to prevent those larger keys from wobbling when 
                you press on them. 
            </p>
            <img class="guideImg2" src="\static\photos\switches.jpg">
            <p>
                Switches are crucial for customizing the feel and sound of your keyboard. 
                There are so many different switch types out there but they are mostly broken down into three different categories: linear, clicky, and tactile.
            </p>

            <p>
                This part really sets the aesthetic for your board. When you sit down to type, youâ€™ll be 
                interacting with the keycaps the most. The profile, design, and durability of the keycaps is really important.
